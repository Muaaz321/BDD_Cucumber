Two types of Reg Expressions in Cucumber:

1. Regular Expression: [0-9]+, (\\d+)
2. Cucumber Expression (introduced in 2017) 

Rules:
1. Step def file will be generating cucumber expression only by default
2. But you can use regular expression also in step def file 
3. You can mix both regular and cucumber expression in step definition file
4. But you can not mix both expressions in the same step definition method

Quantifiers in Reg Expression:
Define, how many times a character needs to be occurred
